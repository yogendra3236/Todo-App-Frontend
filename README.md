## Simple-ToDo React App
In this project, I made a simple todo-app using [react.js ](https://reactjs.org/), the JavaScript library, in which you can add, edit and delete the task as per use.

### Requirements and How to Run?

First, open your terminal, and write the following command to clone the repository <br>
`git clone https://github.com/yogendra3236/Todo-React-App.git`
<br>
and, install the necessary dependencies by `sudo npm install`

Then, you can start running your localhost server in development mode by writing the followinng commands onto your terminal. <br>
`npm start`
<br>

You're ready to go! Happy Coding:)
